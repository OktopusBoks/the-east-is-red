This mod aims to expand the mechanics for the socialist countries in the game including alternate technologies and production methods that were not explored in our time line for one reason or another.

Many of the additions are not unique to the socialist countries but are inspired by a socialist modus operandi, one of the main reasons they were not adopted in the capitalist countries.

Socialist mega projects, cybernetics, transformations of government, and many other things are added. Largely these ideas come from contemporary socialist movements or previous socialist experiments.

TOTAL POINTS : 78

- [ ] Laws  32 points
	- [ ] Quotas  15 points  
		Many countries both socialist and capitalist implement(ed) quotas in their legislatures for certain minority groups. Women being the most typical example. Quotas in this submod are divided into Gender, Ethnic, and Worker.

		Socialist countries in the past and present often have a specific number of their seats reserved for trade union federations, women's federations, farmers unions, etc. These are what are represented by the workers quotas.

		Many capitalist countries often had quotas for women. Proportional electoral systems implement this much easier via "zipper lists"

		There are also many examples of systems guaranteeing seats to ethnic minorities in one way or another (New Zealand does this with the Maori)

		Quotas will need to be in 3 categories as they are not mutually exclusive

	- [ ] Sortition  3 points  
		Sortition is picking government seats by lottery. It is the original meaning of the word "democracy".
